The BMI calculator project is a basic introduction to Java GUI using Swing. This app includes a frame and two main plates that are connected via CardLayer. 
The first Panel is for a brief introduction to the App and BMI, requiring the user to enter their name and it also includes a button that, upon activation, will lead the user to the second panel(BMI panel).

The BMI panel has five main elements, including the group button created by radio buttons, where the user can choose their gender which is not mandatory to fill.
next we have two text fields that requier user's height and weight only in numbers; these fields need to be completed to have a result.
The user would receive an error if the fields are empty or the input is not valid:

When the height and weight fields are set, clicking on "Calculate!" button would show the results at the bottom of the page:
